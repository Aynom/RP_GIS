This is a GIS interface of <i>RationalPeak</i> Model implemented to help users derive the basic spatial input parameters of the model such as catchment area, slope, and main channel length from vector data of stream networks, land cover, elevation contours and GPS data.
 
For details on using this tool, the reader is referred to the following relevant chapter in the user manual accompanying the <i>RationalPeak</i> design hydrological model.
